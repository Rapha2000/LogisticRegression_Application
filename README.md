# LogisticRegression_Application

## About this school project

This project took place from September to October 2022 as part of a statistics elective course. It was my first opportunity to use the R software and also the first time dealing with a classification issue. This project was also an opportunity for me to review and discover some mathematical notions, a very important basis that allowed me to better understand the future theoretical and practical courses of data science.

## Modeling the impact of air quality on allergic rhinitis symptoms

The occurrence of respiratory illnesses brought on by industrial pollution has increased along with the expansion of industry. Therefore, is it possible to **describe and predict** the association between **respiratory diseases** and **air quality** using a **model**?

Our team (students Amine, Raphael, and Kaiyuan, with mentor Ms.Dupas) obtained information from close to 400 locals of **Etang de Barre, France**, where the prevalence of asthma is higher than the nation's mean. We then managed and analyzed the data under Access and Rstudio to create a solid **logistic regression model** that accurately predicts
the severity of allergic rhinitis by gender, age, treatment, and airborne NO2 and pollen levels in the region.

This project, carried out at IMT Mines Al√®s as part of an elective course, took place over a period of two months, from the beginning of September 2022 to the end of October 2022. It was concluded with a defense in an amphitheater in front of a jury of a dozen people, composed of mathematics' professors and professionnals from the industrial field.

On this repo, you will find our R markdown file with outputs hidden, the visual support for our defense and an introductory document our tutor gave us at the beginning of our project explaining the different steps of the work and giving some details about variables.

## The repo

On this repo, you will fin the r source code, the r markdown html file (with no outputs for easier reading) and the slides used during the defense in front of the jury.
